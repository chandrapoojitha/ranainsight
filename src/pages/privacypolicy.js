          <h2>Our Security Measures</h2>
          <p>Our websites have security measures in place 
            to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration 
            of the information under our control. We utilize 
            industry standard SSL encryption when accepting your 
            credit card information during the online ordering 
            process, as well as whenever we ask you to login 
            to any of our online student services, such as our 
            library or the student website.
          </p>
          <h2>Definitions</h2>
          <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
          <p>Data created by a web server that is stored 
            on a user’s computer. It provides a way for the 
            website to keep track of a user’s patterns and 
            preferences and, with the cooperation of the web 
            browser, to store them on the user’s own hard disk.
          ​</p>
          <p>The cookies contain a range of URLs (web addresses) 
            for which they are valid. When the browser encounters 
            those URLs again, it sends those specific cookies to 
            the web server. For example, if a user’s ID were 
            stored as a cookie, it would save that person from 
            typing in the same information all over again when 
            accessing that service for the second and subsequent 
            time during the same browser session.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can opt out of the use of cookies by having 
            your browser disable cookies or warn you before 
            accepting a cookie. Look for the cookie options 
            in your browser in the Options or Preferences menu.
          </p>
          <p><strong style={{opacity:0.75}}>NOTE: If you disable cookies in your browser, 
            you will not be able to access any of our secured 
            websites.IP ( Internet Protocol ) Address
          </strong></p>
          <p>
            This is the address of a computer attached to a 
            TCP/IP network. Every client and server station 
            must have a unique IP address. Client workstations 
            have either a permanent address or one that is 
            dynamically assigned for each dial-up session. 
            IP addresses are written as four sets of numbers 
            separated by periods; for example, 204.171.64.2.
          </p>
          <h2>Browser Session</h2>
          <p>A browser session is defined as the period 
            of time a browser is in consecutive use. 
            The session begins when you open the browser 
            and ends when you close it. When you reopen 
            the browser, you begin a new session.
          </p>
          <h2>SSL Encryption ( Secure Sockets Layer )</h2>
          <p>The leading security protocol on the Internet. 
            When a SSL session is started, the browser sends 
            its public key to the server so that the server 
            can securely send a secret key to the browser. 
            The browser and server exchange data via secret 
            key encryption during that session. We also use 
            SSL encryption whenever we display your personal 
            information (e.g., name and address, scheduled 
            courses, grades).URL ( Uniform Resource Locator )
          </p>
          <p><strong style={{color:`#0E1E40`,opacity:0.75}}>
            An Internet address. URLs are used to locate sites 
            on the Internet and to navigate between sites and 
            pages within sites. The URL for Rana Insight
